                        This project analyzes the different <strong>Warby Parker</strong>'s Marketing Funnel in order to calculate conversion rates. 
                        Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world. For every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need. <br><br>
                        
                        To help users find their perfect frame, Warby Parker has a Style Quiz that has the following questions: </br> </br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What are you looking for?</li> 
                            <li>What's your fit?</li>
                            <li>Which shapes do you like?</li>
                            <li>Which colors do you like?</li>
                            <li>When was your last eye exam?</li>
                        </ol> </br>
                        This is what our table looks like.

                        Users will “give up” at different points in the survey.Let’s analyze how many users move from Question 1 to Question 2, etc.
                        Create a quiz funnel using the GROUP BY command.<br><br>
                        <em>What is the number of responses for each question?</em><br>
                        Let's use this query. <br>
                        <br>
                        <div class = "accordion-item-body-content-code">
                            SELECT question, <br>
                            COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)<br>
                            FROM survey<br>
                            GROUP BY question;<br>

                        <br>
                        We then get this result,
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/sql-2.png">
                        <br>
                        As we can see, out of <strong>500</strong> users who started the survey, only <strong>270</strong> people actually completed the survey. <br><br>
                        <br>
                        Using a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets, let's calculate the percentage of users who answer each question:<br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Which question(s) of the quiz have a lower completion rates?</li> 
                            <li>What do you think is the reason?</li>
                        </ol></br>
                        <img src="images/percentage.png">
                        <br>
                        The 5th question has the lowest servey answers. The reason could be because they forgot their last exam or did not have an eye exam prior to purchase.

                            Warby Parker's purchase funnel is:<br>
                            <em>Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses</em><br>
                            During the Home Try-On stage, we will be conducting an A/B Test:
                            <ul>
                                <li>50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on</li>
                                <li>50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Let's find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.<br><br>
                            Let's run this query.<br><br>

                        <strong>Codeflix,</strong> a streaming video startup, is interested in measuring their user churn rate. In this project, we'll be helping them answer these questions about their churn: <br><br>

                            <li>What is the overall churn trend since the company started?</li>

                        </ol><br>

                        Segment 30 has the lowest churn rates for the first three months. That means less people are unsubscribing and that is better because that's how we generate sales. We want people to continue their subscription.<br>

                    Let's first find out how many campaign and sources does CoolShirts use and which source is used for each campaign.<br><br>
                    Let's run these queries. <br><br>

                    CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Given our findings in the project, which should they pick and why?<br><br>
                    <em>CoolTShirt should re-invest in campaigns that generated more sales. On the other hand, it would be helpful if we also study the other campaigns that generated low purchase conversion and see what we can do to improve them.</em><br>
